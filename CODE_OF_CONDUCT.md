# Code of Conduct

In short: Be respectful; always.

This community is comprised of real people.  By definition, we are all different.  Always keep that in mind.  That said, we are all the same in that we all want to be treated with basic respect and dignity that simply being a person entitles us to.

## Collaborate

There is strength in diversity.  Everyone sees things a little bit differently.  Combining our perspectives and putting them into action is a powerful tool.

There will be differences of opinion.  Embrace that and communicate openly with each other.  Try to help the other person see your point of view.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe they're right.  Maybe you're both right (or wrong).  You won't know until you talk it out.

## Take responsibility

No matter how diligent we are, things can and will go wrong eventually.  If you caused or contributed to an issue, own it.  We don't seek to point fingers at all.  Knowing how an issue was caused can help lead to a more timely resolution. Taking responsibility for your actions, and helping to correct the issue, when possible, can lead to a stronger community overall.  It can also be an opportunity in disguise to build trust with others.

In contrast, when you do something that is a success, large or small, take pride, but be humble.  If praise is warranted, it should come organically, not be sought.  Likewise, if you see something worth commending, do so.  A well-timed "good job" can go a long way.

## Violations

There will inevitably be some bad actors.  However, please bear in mind that most people do not seek to actively offend or behave poorly.  When you encounter activity that you believe violates this Code of Conduct, talk it out amongst yourselves first, remembering to be respectful.  Please also remember that being offended in and of itself is not a violation of this Code of Conduct.  If someone else's opinion differs from yours and you find that offensive, remember, by that reasoning, your opinion is just as offensive to them as theirs is to you.  Additionally, while words are powerful, they carry many different meanings in different communities and what you find derogatory or offensive may not be by a different definition or in another's community.  Again, talk it out amongst yourselves first before reporting it.  Moderators are not babysitters and will not conduct themselves as such.

There are, of course, obvious violations which we won't enumerate here, to avoid the perception of having a hard and fast list of such.  If you believe you have observed a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it [here](https://nucleus.one/contact/).  Those found in violation will be subject to one or more of the following consequences, depending on the severity and/or repetition of the offense, as determined by moderators; warning, temporary ban, permanent ban.  This list is not exhaustive.

## Conclusion

This Code of Conduct is not exhaustive.  It does not define nor address every possible scenario that may arise, nor does it seek to.  Its intent is to create a foundation of common understanding of how we are *all* expected to conduct ourselves at all times.  It is intended to be followed in spirit, more so than it is by the letter.  It may also be updated at any time in the future, with or without notice.
