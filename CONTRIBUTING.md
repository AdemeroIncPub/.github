Developing for Nucleus One
--------------------------

To develop for Nucleus One, you will first need to get your dev environment set up.  In-house, we use
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which runs on most OSes.  You are welcome to use
another IDE, such as Android Studio, but much of our setup is configured to run using VS Code.

Getting started is straightforward, just clone the repositories you want to work on.


Documentation
-------------------------

Generally speaking, our apps and SDKs are self documented.  That is, where a comment-based
documentation exists for a given platform, such as Dart (i.e. [dartdoc](https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc)),
documentation of classes, parameters, etc., usage and even sample code should make use of such system.
This way, documentation can be automatically generated and updated in other formats (e.g. HTML).
